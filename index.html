					<h3>What is the World Wide Web?</h3>
					<p>The World Wide Web also known as “WWW” is a collection of web resources and application which can access resources via the internet.</p>

					<h3>The Birth of the World Wide Web</h3>
					<p>The World Wide Web was invented at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee in the year 1989. It started when Tim noticed that they were having difficulties in sharing information. That’s why Tim developed the www for them to share information between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. He also suggested that you could actually link the text in the files themselves.</p>
					<p>Instead of reading one research paper at a time, you could just display part of another paper that holds directly relevant text. The documentations of a specific mathematical nature would be represented as a ‘web’ of information which is held in electronic form on computers across the world. Tim thought that is could be done by using a hypertext, linking documents together by using buttons on the screen, where you can just simply click on to jump from one paper to another.</p>

				<h3>HTTP RESOURCE ADDRESSING</h3>
				<p>HTTP Resources are identified using URLs (RFC 3986) or more specifically, HTTP URLs</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h4>Uniform Resource Locators(URL)</h4>
						<p>Uniform Resource Locators (URL) is a type of URI. URL is a website address that identifies  the location of a website or a file. The URL contains the protocol to be use followed by the ip address and domain name.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Scheme</h4>
						<p>http or https</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Authority</h4>
						<p>User information or authentication credentials(deprecated)</p>		
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Domain Name</h4>
						<p>Resolve to an IP Address using DNS of the server where the resource resides or will be created</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Path to Resource</h4>
						<p>Resolve relative to the document root on the server. It may also refer to a static or dynamic resource</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Query</h4>
						<p>oTypically provided as key-value pairs, with ampersand(&)separators between key/value pairs.</p>

					<li>
						<h4>Fragment Identifier</h4>
						<p>Pound Sign (#)</p>

				<h3>HTTP MESSAGE: REQUEST AND RESPONSE</h3>
				<p>HTTP message is a blocks of data that is sent by client to the server and vice versa. There are two kinds of HTTP message namely request and response message.</p>
				<h4>Response</h4>
				<p>It is the reply of the server to the client. The client will send a request message with the following format. The server will now then receive the message and interpret it and respond to it with the same message format.</p>
				<h4>Request</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>messages that is sent by client to the server.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>(CRLF –term line consisting of 3 space separated values)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Method</p>
