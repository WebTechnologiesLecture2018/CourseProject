					<h3>The Birth of the World Wide Web</h3>
					<p>The World Wide Web was invented at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee in the year 1989. It started when Tim noticed that they were having difficulties in sharing information. That’s why Tim developed the www for them to share information between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. He also suggested that you could actually link the text in the files themselves.</p>
					<p>Instead of reading one research paper at a time, you could just display part of another paper that holds directly relevant text. The documentations of a specific mathematical nature would be represented as a ‘web’ of information which is held in electronic form on computers across the world. Tim thought that is could be done by using a hypertext, linking documents together by using buttons on the screen, where you can just simply click on to jump from one paper to another.</p>
